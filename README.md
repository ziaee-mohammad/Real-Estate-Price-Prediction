# 🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction

A data-driven project to predict real estate prices using property features such as **location**, **area**, and **number of bedrooms/bathrooms**.  
The model applies regression analysis to estimate house prices accurately and provides insights into market trends.

---

## 🔍 Overview
- Clean and preprocess housing data (handle missing values, normalize features).  
- Engineer meaningful features (price per square foot, total area, etc.).  
- Detect and remove outliers using domain-based logic.  
- Train and evaluate regression models to predict property prices.  
- Visualize trends for price distribution and location-based variation.

## 🗂 Dataset
Dataset used: *Bangalore House Price Dataset*  
Includes:  
- Location  
- Area (sqft)  
- Bedrooms / Bathrooms  
- Price

## 📈 Key Insights
- Strong correlation between **location** and **price per sqft**.  
- Outlier removal improves model stability.  
- Linear Regression performs well for structured real estate data.  
- Price trends show higher values in central Bangalore regions.
